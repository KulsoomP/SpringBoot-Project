spring-boot + thymeleaf + maven + MySQL Workbench

That sounds like a great project! I designed a web application with an admin panel and user functionality. Here's a breakdown of the functionalities you mentioned:

Admin Panel:
Add, update, and delete functionality: You can create database tables to store the items in your system. Use the "Table" tab in MySQL Workbench to design and manage your database schema. You can add, modify, or delete records in the tables using SQL queries or the visual interface provided by MySQL Workbench.

User Functionality:
Login and logout: Users can log in to the system using their credentials and log out when done.
Add item to cart: Users can select items from a list, add them to their cart, fetch records from table, and show to user .

Thymeleaf is a server-side Java-based template engine that is commonly used in web development with frameworks like Spring Boot.
